# Food_ordering
The proposed project is a Online Food ordering system is a process in which one can order various foods and beverages from some local restaurant and hotels through the use of the internet, just by sitting at home or any place. And the order is delivered to the told location.

Nowadays everyone has a busy schedule whether it is in urban or rural areas. But talking specifically about the urban areas and deeply about the big cities, people out there are so busy in their life that they donâ€™t get enough time to have their meals properly.

These days women are no less than men, in any field. So in big cities even wives are working women, therefore mostly the small families manage to have their food ordered from somewhere, as they lack time.

Not only this is the case, if we talk about the children in the modern era they like only fast food or something from the outside. But they ignore eating homemade meals.

So the food ordering system these days has one of the fastest growing markets, though being a new idea. In this project we have developed something like the same to earn from and serve the nation in a much better way possible.

Nowadays, people are more likely to dine-in at restaurants for their meals. The online food ordering system provides convenience for the customers that are nothing special but the general busy people of the society.


It overcomes the demerits of the manual hotel or mess system and the old fashioned queuing system. This system enhances the readymade of foods.
